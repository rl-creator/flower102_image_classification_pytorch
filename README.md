Creating a neural network to examine and classify images of flowers.

Using the Flower102 dataset.

Neural netwrok developed using PyTorch.

flower102_image_classification.ipynb contains an examination and visualization of the image data and an inital model.
flower102_img_classfctn_pytorch_new_model.ipynb contains reworked code and a modified model.
